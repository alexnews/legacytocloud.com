💡 The Big Idea Behind LegacyToCloud.com

1. Companies are stuck with old databases
	•	Their MySQL/Oracle/SQL Server systems are slow, fragile, expensive, and hard to change.
	•	Migrating them to modern platforms is scary and risky, so they postpone it for years.

⸻

2. Migrations fail because they are done wrong
	•	People try simple “dump → restore → hope it works”.
	•	They ignore:
	•	data quality issues
	•	incompatible types
	•	missing documentation
	•	hidden dependencies
	•	incremental sync
	•	Result: downtime, broken apps, huge costs.

⸻

3. LegacyToCloud.com provides a repeatable system that works

We create playbooks + tools + consulting that:
	•	Analyze old databases automatically
	•	Generate a clean target schema (Postgres, Snowflake, Databricks)
	•	Move data safely with incremental sync
	•	Validate everything
	•	Support a near zero-downtime cutover

This removes guesswork and chaos.

⸻

4. It’s both a PRODUCT and a SERVICE

LegacyToCloud.com offers:

Software (SaaS):
	•	Schema analyzer
	•	Migration plan generator
	•	Incremental sync engine
	•	Validation & monitoring dashboard

Consulting:
	•	We help companies execute migrations end-to-end
	•	Or train their engineers how to do it safely

⸻

5. All migrations follow the same patterns

Whether it’s:
	•	MySQL → PostgreSQL
	•	MySQL → Snowflake
	•	SQL Server → Databricks

The core needs are the same:
	•	Analyze → Plan → Bulk Load → Incremental Sync → Validate → Cutover → Optimize

So LegacyToCloud turns this into a standardized, repeatable pipeline.

⸻

6. Why this business works
	•	Every company eventually MUST modernize.
	•	Migration is painful → they prefer experts + automation.
	•	Market is huge: finance, ecommerce, healthcare, government, SaaS companies.
	•	We offer tools + consulting, which means:
	•	recurring SaaS revenue
